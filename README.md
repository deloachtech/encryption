Encryption Package
==================

An Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit class for PHP.

[Understanding AES 256 Encryption](https://www.n-able.com/blog/aes-256-encryption-algorithm)

Installation
------------

```bash
composer require deloachtech/encryption
```

Or download the package and use the class itself. (All class methods are static.)

Usage
-----

### Create a key

```php
echo AES256Encryprion::generateKey();
```

There should be no issue using the same key for all records in terms of security. Using a different key does not give you any advantage (in fact, it will be a real headache to manage), so one key should usually be good enough. There are probably many solutions to storing keys securely, but those depend on the level of security you really need.

### Encrypting data

```php
$iv = AES256Encryption::generateIv();
$encryptedText = AES256Encryption::encrypt($text, $key, $iv);
```

You can simply store the initialization vector (IV) in the database next to the encrypted data. The IV itself is not supposed to be secret. It usually acts as a salt, to avoid a situation where two identical plaintext records get encrypted into identical ciphertext. Storing the IV in the database for each row will eliminate the concern over losing this data. Ideally, each row IV would be unique and random but not secret. (You can also use the record index value as an IV.)

### Decrypting data

```php
$decryptedText = AES256Encryption::decrypt($encryptedText, $key, $iv);
```
